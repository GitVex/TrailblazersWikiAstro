## Background

Isaaka made a name for himself as a smuggler and intelligence broker, but his ambition and greed often led him into trouble. He gained minor infamy after providing intelligence to a Terran Mission in the [[Kryx Nebula Fields]], earning enough credits to buy a small ship. With dreams of uncovering lost pretech treasures, Isaaka assembled a small crew and embarked on a quest to a rumored pretech archive storage on [[Kerkwijk System|Ommekeer, Kerkwijk]].

However, things went awry when a Danube Research Squad ambushed his crew. After their crew got scooped up by a Danube Research Squad, they escaped the system without treasure. Figuring that one of them tipped them off, Isaaka quickly accused the crew of a mutany. In a short firefight, his crewmates disbanded their working relations by taking his shuttle and flying off.

One of those crewmates, Obert Longman, remains a thorn in Isaaka’s side. Isaaka placed a bounty on Longman’s head, making Obert the Target of the PC's in the [[Albion Spaceport Arc]]. With limited resources after his failed ventures, Isaaka now seeks an opportunity to raid the legendary Vault at the [[The Crater Oasis|Crater Oasis]], offering the PCs a share of the spoils to fund their efforts.

## Goals and Motivations

Isaaka’s primary motivation is personal wealth and freedom. He dreams of retiring in luxury, far from the dangers of smuggling and treasure hunting.

Isaaka’s paranoia and distrust of others often isolate him, making it difficult for him to form lasting alliances.
