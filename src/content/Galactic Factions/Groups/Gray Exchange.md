## Profile 
The Gray Exchange is the galaxy's most prominent Black Market. It acts as an umbrella term for locations of illicit trade, partially funded by [[Lanternyard Inc.]]. The Exchange has branches and known holdouts in almost every sector of the galaxy. Due to its decentralized nature, authorities are almost powerless to curb the organization completely. A lack of international policing also prevents most progress of containing the criminal activities.

## Activities 

- Smuggling contraband goods such as weapons, illicit substances, and unregistered artifacts.
- Human and alien trafficking for labor, information, or espionage.
- Extortion of traders, smugglers, and businesses through protection rackets.
- Black-market auction houses for rare, restricted, or banned items.
- Information brokering, including stolen government data or corporate secrets.

## Story 

The Gray Exchange began as a loose coalition of smugglers and outcasts in the outer rim territories. Over centuries, it evolved into a highly organized criminal empire, bound together by shared interests and an ironclad code of secrecy. It gained further prominence when Lanternyard Inc. saw an opportunity to monopolize both legitimate and illegal supply chains, funding its expansion covertly.

Rumors suggest a central figure, known only as **The Broker**, oversees major operations. The Broker's identity remains one of the galaxy’s greatest mysteries.
