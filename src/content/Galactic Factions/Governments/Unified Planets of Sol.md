## Profile 

The Unified Planets of Sol were the original human §1§government that formed from Earth and its Colonies.§§ Through History it has gone through many changes, through internal and external struggles which have shaped it into the bureaucratic Behemoth it is today. Once spanning most of the Galaxy, the space that is now under unified planet jurisdiction focuses on the galactic South and East.

It offers its citizens a lush quality of life over many worlds, though its ideology sometimes clashes with minority groups on both a diplomatic and sometimes even a military level.

## Powers and Duties 
The Unified Planets of Sol operates as a stabilizing force within its territory, promoting law, order, and a high standard of living for its citizens. Key duties include:

- **Interstellar Security and Defense**: Through the Unified Planets Navy (UPN) and other military branches, the UPoS safeguards its borders, especially along sensitive areas like the [[Kryx Nebula Fields]] and the Serengeti Line.

- **Galactic Governance**: The metafederal structure allows local autonomy for sectors while centralizing critical policies. This includes the regulation of interstellar trade, enforcement of universal rights, and environmental preservation across colonized worlds.

- **Technological Advancement**: UPoS leads in researching and regulating advanced technologies, with particular emphasis on starship propulsion, sustainable energy sources, and ethical Machine Intelligence.

## Story 

#### Earth Relocation
After the discovery of the Jetgates, Earth was moved to a star system close to the Gaia BH1 black hole in a monumental feat of engineering.

Humanity, already having colonized large parts of the surrounding star systems through the development of _Short-Warp_ in 2102, a ship-drive which can propel a starship over lightyears in superlight speeds. For example, in 2142, a voyage from Earth to Alpha Centauri (4,36 lightyears) took around 1 month with Short-Warp. With modern short-warp engines, this time got cut down to 1 hour.

From these resources, Humanity built a giant drive-array in the pacific ocean to propel earth from it's host star to the Gaia system at the turn of the century in 2200. Given that Earth's formal name is still Sol III, the newly founded government was likewise named "Unified Planets of Sol" Due to the composition of the star Gaia and the position of earth's new orbit, the sky is tinged in an twilight orange-red 80% of the day, only clearing up during the middle of the day.
San Francisco has become the Capital of Earth, and as such the Capital of the UPoS. Earth is experiencing a retro-phase where it has become very hip to dress like old 80s Noir films.
#### First Gate War (2318 - 2329)

By the late 2300s, the UPoS had consolidated much of known space, but this rapid growth left vast regions under loose control, with only a modest civilian fleet to patrol and protect them. Wealthy trading syndicates and resource-rich colonies began commissioning their own armed vessels, forming what they claimed were "defensive" flotillas to guard against piracy. In reality, many of these private forces blurred the line between commerce and coercion, some even conducting raids on neighboring systems. UPoS leaders were hesitant to respond forcefully, fearing that increased militarization could fracture their fragile alliances. However, the threat grew undeniable as these factions coalesced under a new government, which would evolve into the Terran Empire over the course of the war. When rumors spread that this coalition had begun smuggling arms through the Jetgates, the UPoS finally mobilized its resources, drafting civilian ships and hastily forming a defense force to confront the insurrection

#### Second Gate War (2400 - 2420)
The **Second Gate War** ignited at the turn of the century with an assassination attempt on **Ambassador Eliyana Draven**, the chief diplomat overseeing UPoS relations with neutral systems bordering Imperial space. Draven was a known advocate for extending UPoS influence in the Kryx Nebula through alliances and trade agreements, something that the Terran Empire found threatening to their growing sphere of influence. Her efforts in solidifying treaties with border systems and ensuring access to key trade routes were undermining the Empire's covert expansion and tightening their options for strategic and diplomatic maneuvering. ![[IMG_0711.jpeg|right|450]]

The war quickly escalated, with skirmishes erupting across the Kryx Fields and toward the southern galactic edges, but the focal point of conflict was in the rallying of independent world in **the Kryx**. The Kryx Nebula Fields are a giant region of space rich in resources, which could bring whoever has the most influence over it a major advantage in the stirring war-for-knowledge that started to develop in the milky way. Though this highly political, nuanced and multi-faceted factor of the war was never the focus of the public. Instead, the main civilian attention was at the direct borders between the UPoS and the Empire.

The **Battle at the Twin Gates** became the culturally defining period of the war. The Arcadia sector held two rare and highly strategic Jetgates within UPoS space, remnants of UPoS control since the First Gate War. The gates are positioned only a few hundred lightyears apart, and became a critical choke point; if the UPoS Outbound Gate, the southern one, fell into Imperial hands, they would gain direct access to several key sectors. The UPN deployed over half of its fleet, fortifying the line between the two Jetgates to mount a defense. The Imperial navy, In a surprise strike with diversions in other battlefields, captured the Empire Outbound Gate. The battle raged on for weeks. Despite the Terran Empire’s fierce assaults, the UPoS defenders managed to hold, preventing a breakthrough to the Gate that would allow access to the rest of UP space. No one won the Battle at the Twin Gates, and the line still stands as it was back then. Attrition wore both sides down to a grinding halt in other parts of the galactic south, and eventually, a necessary **ceasefire** established itself. Parallel to that, the Empire saw itself diminished in its ability to wage war due to the events in the [[Terran Civil War]].

The war ended with the formal establishment of the **Serengeti Line**, a heavily patrolled demilitarized zone running along the contested territories. While it was seen as a miracle in the diplomatic community, it only solidified a tense, cold-war stalemate between the UPoS and the new state of the Confederacy of Terran Gates.

#### Unified Planets Navy
During the Buildup to the [[First Gate War]] in 2318, §1§A fleet of militia warships§§ was scrapped together from the before almost exclusively civilian fleet of ships roaming human space. Against the what was then still considered just a collection of pirate syndicates, this was not enough for the clearly intentional arming of the imperial ships.
The lesson was learned and by the start of the [[Second Gate War]] roughly 60 years later in 2389, both sides had an influential and galaxy spanning military projection force that was hard to look at when clashed together along the lines of today's demilitarized zone, the [[Serengeti Line]].
The [[Unified Planets Navy|UPN]] boasts a roster of different starship models for fleet wide operations, while also being the vessel for any other branches of the military like the Unified Planets Army, Intelligence Bureau and others.
