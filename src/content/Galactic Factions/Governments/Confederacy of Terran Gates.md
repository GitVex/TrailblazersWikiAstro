### Iconography

## Profile 
The Confederacy of Terran Gates is a powerful, militaristic, and economically driven faction. Emerging as a significant antagonist to the Unified Planets of Sol (UPoS), the Confederacy's primary ambition lies in territorial expansion, control over strategic resources, and the restoration of Terran cultural and political dominance in the galaxy.

The Confederacy is a coalition of the Jetgate systems that seceded from the Unified Planets of Sol during the First Gate War in 2318. It emerged from the remnants of the Terran Empire, which fractured during the Terran Civil War, ending in 2420.
## Powers and Duties 

- **Military Strength**: Operates a formidable navy with cutting-edge technology, capable of engaging in large-scale conflicts and rapid territorial acquisition.
- **Economic Influence**: Engages in trade and resource exploitation, particularly in contested zones like the [[Kryx Nebula Fields]].
- **Diplomatic Tactics**: Uses covert operations and alliances to undermine UPoS influence and rally neutral systems to its side.
- **Intelligence Operations**: Conducts espionage and propaganda to destabilize opposition and control narratives within its territories and beyond.
## Philosophy 

The CoTG is grounded in a philosophy of pragmatic nationalism. While it cherishes the cultural legacy of the Terran Empire, it seeks to balance unity with the autonomy of its member gates. Its central tenet is that governance should empower local systems rather than impose overarching policies, a stance that differentiates it sharply from the UPoS and the authoritarian Terran Empire.

## Organization 

**Headquarters**: Cygnus, Cygnus | Zameen, Alpha Serpentis

**Leader(s)**: High Commissionate Moreno Rigali

**Prominent Members**:
- **Admiral Klyne Teraxis**: Renowned fleet commander and veteran of the Kryx Nebula skirmishes.
- **Gatemaster Raleen Vos**: Leader of the Kepler Gate, known for her reforms and diplomatic acumen.
- **High Commissionate Moreno Rigali**: Current figurehead, elected by the Serpentis Council, emphasizing unity and military expansion.

Each Sector has its own governing Ruler, the **Gatemaster**, and the whole nation is headed by the Serpentis Council, which in turn is headed by the "High Commissionate of the Confederacy of Terran Gates".

Each Gate decides on national matters in the Serpentis Council, The council is composed of representatives chosen by each sector's Gatemaster and advises the High Commissionate. They meet in plenum annually or in situations of special need in the Alpha Serpentis System.
#### Gatemasters and Sector Governance
Each Sector operates as an independent political entity, ruled by its Gatemaster, whose authority is derived from their Gate’s unique customs and laws. For example, the Betelgeuse Gate selects its Gatemaster through a sacred hunt: a Gatemaster Aspirant must slay an [[Aaralonga]], a protected species of Spacewhale, and present its head to the reigning Gatemaster to claim the title. In contrast, the Kepler Gate elects its Gatemaster through a Rite of Knowledge, where some significant contribution needs to be made by an Aspirant to be eligible.

To avoid instability, sectors with succession rituals that might fail—due to external circumstances such as dwindling resources—are required to have fallback mechanisms, such as temporary councils or elections, to ensure continuity of governance.

The Gatemasters act as sovereign rulers within their territories, with full control over internal policies, economies, and laws. However, conflicts between Sectors, such as disputes over border territories or trade, are mediated by the **Arbitration Chamber of the Serpentis Council**, a neutral body empowered to enforce resolutions.
#### High Commissionate of the Confederacy
The High Commissionate, elected by a majority vote of the Serpentis Council every eight years, serves as the Confederacy's primary mediator and figurehead. The Commissionate cannot unilaterally impose laws or decrees, acting instead as a facilitator of council decisions and a symbolic unifier. During emergencies, the Commissionate can invoke **Emergency Mediation Powers** to temporarily align the Confederacy's actions, but these powers are strictly limited in scope and duration.
#### Bureau of the Nation
The Bureau serves as the **administrative arm** of the Confederacy of Terran Gates. While the **Serpentis Council** handles legislative and advisory responsibilities, the Bureau translates these decisions into actionable policies and ensures coordination across the sectors.

## Background 

The Confederacy of Terran gates originated from the [[Terran Empire]], which were the 8 Jetgates which had separate themselves from the Unified Planets of Sol in 2318. The Confederacy was established after the [[Terran Civil War]] in 2420 along with the end of the Second Gate War, where multiple factions within the Empire and its gates rose up against the increasingly authoritarian regime that grew in influence on Cygnus. Compared to its predecessor, the CTG is less involved in sector-level policies, which was a major reason why the gates seceded from the UPoS in the first place.

## Additional Details

- [[Serengeti Line]]: A heavily patrolled demilitarized zone marking the tense Cold War stalemate with the UPoS.
