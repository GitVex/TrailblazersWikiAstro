## Story

Danube Research Corp. began as a Lanternyard subsidiary, tasked with uncovering and reverse-engineering pretech artifacts. A turning point came when DRC recovered a major pretech data artifact, which revolutionized Jetgate travel. Over time, DRC gained independence, though it remains closely aligned with Lanternyard.

Their history is rife with controversy, including allegations of corporate espionage, human experimentation on Navigators, and sabotage of rival research efforts. Their activities often blur ethical lines, pursuing advancement at any cost.

## Philosophy

**"The future is written in the relics of the past."**  
Danube’s philosophy §1§revolves around leveraging ancient knowledge for modern innovation§§. While they claim to honor the legacy of the civilizations that built the Jetgates, their methods often prioritize progress over ethical considerations.

## Organization

**Headquarters**: Classified, [[Fornax System|Area-112, Fornax]]
**Leader(s)**: Unknown  
**Prominent Members**: Anonymous agents embedded across the galaxy

Danube operates §1§in a decentralized manner, using covert teams, §2§black-site labs§§, and proxies to avoid scrutiny§§. This structure allows them to conduct high-risk, high-reward research without jeopardizing their official operations.

| Classified black-site labs | Hidden facilities for high-risk experimentation   | Lanternyard funding          | Developing cutting-edge technology                  |
| Centauri Disc              | Ancient knowledge of Jetgat particulo-dynamics    | Recovered from unknown ruins | Optimized ship design and Jetgate use               |
| Experimental neural tech   | Neural interfaces for advanced starship operation | Proprietary research         | Used in Lanternyard’s flagship ships and Navigators |
#### Pretech Artifact
In the early days of Lanternyard, a Danube Agent uncovered a data cache of unknown origin in the Alpha Centauri system. They found this cache on an asteroid that was being mined by Lanternyard for its resources. Given their involvement, the two groups struck a deal which supplied Danube with funding, and Lanternyard with the information contained in the artifact.

Later dubbed the "Centauri Disc", it contained a schematic of Alien drive technology. This jump-started Lanternyard's Enterprise into Jetgate Travel.
