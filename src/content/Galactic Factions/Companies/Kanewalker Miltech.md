## Story 

Founded by former military engineer Victor Kanewalker, Kanewalker Miltech began as a small research and development lab focused on improving the survivability of planetary defense forces. Over decades, it grew into a major corporation supplying cutting-edge combat vehicles to both private security forces and galactic militaries. Their designs emphasize adaptability, modular systems, and brute efficiency, appealing to both lawful governments and rogue factions.

In recent years, Kanewalker Miltech has faced scrutiny for selling advanced weaponry to neutral or contested sectors, drawing criticism but also immense profits. Their products are a common sight in conflicts ranging from planetary insurrections to large-scale sector disputes.

## Philosophy 

*"Survival through superior firepower."*  
Kanewalker Miltech believes in creating tools that give their users the decisive advantage, with no compromise on quality or durability. They espouse a pragmatic view of warfare: only the well-prepared survive.
