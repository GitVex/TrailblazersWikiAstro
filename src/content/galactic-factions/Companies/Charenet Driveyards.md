## Story 

Charenet Driveyards, founded roughly a century ago, started as a modest **repair station** in the Charenet system. As the Unified Planets of Sol expanded, Charenet Driveyards grew into a local manufacturing powerhouse specializing in propulsion technology. With the declaration of Sovereignty of Lanternyard Inc., Charenet quickly established itself as their premier manufacturer, developing specialized drives to endure the harsh conditions of gate travel. Their technological prowess made them a preferred supplier for Lanternyard Inc. and allied factions, securing contracts that led to exponential growth.

Today, Charenet Driveyards operates with a fiercely practical approach. The company’s ethos emphasizes reliability, precision, and adaptability. Recently, they’ve encountered political pressure as they balance manufacturing demands from both Lanternyard Inc. and the Unified Planets, especially in the context of the **Cold War** with the Confederacy of Terran Gates, where a contract to supply a Terran Company was shut down by the [[Unified Planets of Sol#Organization|Prime House]].

## Organization 

**Headquarters**: [[Charenet System|Charenet, Albion]]

**Leader(s)**: Claude Geratti (CEO)

**Prominent Members**:
- **Claude Geratti (CEO)**: A visionary with a background in engineering, Geratti led Charenet through its rise to prominence by prioritizing Lanternyard’s needs and maintaining close relations with its leaders.
- **Raisa Tanaka (Head of Propulsion R&D)**: Known for her innovative designs and keen risk assessment, Tanaka oversees R&D, particularly regarding Jetgate-compatible drives.
- **Felix Ordun (Director of Manufacturing)**: A meticulous leader, Ordun is responsible for Charenet’s stringent quality control standards across its factories.

## Resources 
- **Manufacturing Facilities**: The main factory in Charenet can produce advanced propulsion units and specialized drives on a large scale.
- **Proprietary Technology**: Charenet has developed several proprietary drive systems adapted for Jetgate use, which are only available to clients under Lanternyard Inc.

## Methods 
- **Meticulous Quality Control**: Every drive undergoes a multi-stage quality control process to ensure long-lasting reliability, particularly for the extreme conditions of Jetgate travel.
- **Research and Development**: The R&D team is tasked with creating efficient, compact, and highly adaptable propulsion systems, often in collaboration with Lanternyard scientists.
- **Controlled Distribution**: Propulsion technology is distributed only to approved entities, primarily Lanternyard Inc., with strict export restrictions to prevent unauthorized use.
## Background 

Founded shortly after the discovery of the Jetgates, Charenet Driveyards has its roots in the early days of interstellar expansion. The company initially catered to privateers and explorers, creating engines designed to survive the unpredictable forces near black holes and Jetgate poles. As word of their durable drives spread, Lanternyard Inc. approached Charenet with a lucrative contract, shifting the company’s focus toward large-scale production for corporate and commercial clients.

Throughout its history, Charenet has faced challenges from pirate factions, competitors, and rogue factions attempting to steal their proprietary designs. To protect their intellectual property, Charenet invests in strict security measures, both digital and physical, with a private security force stationed at major facilities.
## Additional Details 

- **Known Drive Types**: The “Marathon” is Charenet’s most popular engine model, known for its durability and energy efficiency. Recently, the company has been developing a next-generation drive capable of harnessing momentum in prolonged exposure to high-magnetic zones with proprietary micro-slingshots, inspired by A-1832’s own magnetic anomalies.
- **R&D Initiative**: Project Nexus aims to create an engine that can perform well within the matter noisy Kryx Nebula Fields, which leads to stalling in particulary dense nebula zones. This would position Charenet Driveyards to expand its market further from the civilian into the industrial sector, catering to the numerous bodies acting in the Kryx.
