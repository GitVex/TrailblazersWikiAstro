### Iconography

## Profile
Al-Rabata was founded after a group of the 10 largest mining operations in the Unified Planets of Sol began to see taxation loopholes in consolidation. This gave rise to a major Monopoly which caused wide-scale exploitation especially in the frontier sectors of the new colonies.
In the last 100 years, the corporation has regulated itself to be more moderate, with regulations from all major factions in the galaxy pushing for it.
