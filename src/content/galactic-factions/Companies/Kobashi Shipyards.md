## Story  
Founded during the expansionist boom of the 23nd century, Kobashi Shipyards started as a small family-run business supplying starship components to independent traders. Over the centuries, it grew into a major player in the galactic shipbuilding industry, famed for its innovation and commitment to quality. The company’s turning point came with the development of its modular ship designs, which became the standard for explorers and traders operating in uncharted territories. 

Another big step for the company was the procurement of a military contract with the Unified Planets of Sol, opening up a new avenue as a defense contractor.
## Philosophy  
Kobashi Shipyards is guided by the principles of adaptability, resilience, and accessibility. The company believes in empowering individuals and smaller organizations to succeed in the galaxy’s most challenging environments, promoting exploration and growth through dependable technology.
