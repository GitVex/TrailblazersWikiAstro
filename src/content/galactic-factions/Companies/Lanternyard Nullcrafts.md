## Story 

Founded as an integral arm of Lanternyard Inc., Nullcrafts grew out of the necessity to consolidate the corporation’s grip on interstellar logistics. Over decades, it became the dominant shipbuilder for ultrabulk freighters in the galaxy, leveraging its parent company’s influence and resources. Nullcrafts pioneered hull designs **optimized** for Jetgate travel and advanced neural piloting interfaces. The company’s **dockyards** host some of the largest construction facilities, with their shipyards operating at peak capacity in core systems like Volantis and Gaia.

## Philosophy 

Lanternyard Nullcrafts follows a pragmatic ethos: *"Every Ship, a Legacy."* 
Their focus on innovation is tempered by a relentless pursuit of cost-effectiveness, ensuring each vessel maximizes profit potential while maintaining functionality and durability.
