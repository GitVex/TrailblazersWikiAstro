## Profile 

The **Nibbellean Patrol** is a forward-operating fleet of the **Unified Planets Navy**, stationed on the fringes of the Lima Cluster. It is tasked with reconnaissance, anti-piracy operations, and serving as a first line of defense against potential incursions by the **One Earth Government**.

## Story 

The **102nd Nibbellean Patrol** is an elite fleet that takes its name from the fabled defenders of Old Earth legends, the [Nibelungs](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibelungensage).

In recent years, the patrol has faced pirate syndicates exploiting the chaotic trade routes of the Eastern Albion Sector. Recently, internal intelligence has unearthed security breach incident, throwing open the possibility of infiltration from the outside. Despite these odds, the patrol continues to serve as the bulwark of the Unified Planets' interests in the region.

## Background 

Founded as a response to escalating tensions along the **Albion Sector**, the **Nibbellean Patrol** was established to monitor and secure the vulnerable Fringe Systems and its surrounding trade corridors. All ships currently in service were part of the original Task Force. Over the years, resources have been diverted away from the 102nd, and the tenders listed above are just those that have been frequently serving ships on far patrol and are not a guaranteed part of the Task Force.
