## Profile

The **Imperial Remnant** is a splintered network of ex-military leaders, rogue officials, and warlords who refuse to accept the fall of the Terran Empire. They operate covertly as a syndicate, engaging in criminal enterprises to fund their efforts to reestablish authoritarian rule. While their organization lacks central leadership, they remain dangerous through sheer fanaticism and their ability to manipulate fringe systems.

## Activities

- **Arms Trafficking**: Smuggling high-grade weapons, including stolen or reverse-engineered Imperial technology.
- **Piracy**: Attacking trade convoys, especially those aligned with the Unified Planets of Sol or the Confederacy of Terran Gates.
- **Political Corruption**: Bribing local officials and influencing fringe colonies to support their cause.
- **Smuggling**: Transporting contraband, including technology, rare minerals, and stolen artifacts.
- **Espionage and Subversion**: Destabilizing rival governments through covert operations and misinformation campaigns.

## Story

The Imperial Remnant emerged after the collapse of the Terran Empire during the Terran Civil War. Unable to accept their defeat, surviving loyalists scattered across the galaxy, consolidating their resources and forming small but effective cells. These factions maintain the ideology of Imperial supremacy, seeking to reclaim their lost territories and restore the Empire's dominance.

Over the centuries, the Remnant evolved into a criminal syndicate, using illegal activities to sustain its operations. Despite their diminished influence, they continue to disrupt galactic stability, most notably through suspected involvement in the **One Earth Government Insurrection** and collaboration with arms dealers in the [[Kryx Nebula Fields]].
