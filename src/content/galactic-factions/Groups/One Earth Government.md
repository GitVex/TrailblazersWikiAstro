## Profile 

The **One Earth Government (OEG)** is a militarized insurrectionist group masquerading as the last vestige of Terran imperialism. Born from the embers of the Terran Empire’s collapse, the OEG claims to champion Earth’s sovereignty and humanity’s dominance. In practice, they employ terror, subjugation, and exploitation to achieve their authoritarian agenda. Their control of the Helion Sector marks a strategic foothold for their expansionist vision.

## Activities 

The OEG engages in a blend of overt military campaigns and covert criminal enterprises:

- **Insurrectionist Warfare**: Leading rebellions and coups in destabilized systems.
- **Smuggling**: Using Lanternyard routes to funnel illegal goods across sectors.
- **Extortion**: Demanding tribute from planetary governments under their influence.
- **Political Corruption**: Bribing officials and sabotaging UPoS institutions.
- **Covert Espionage**: False-flag operations and intelligence manipulation.

## Story 

The One Earth Government emerged from a coalition of fringe imperial loyalists and pirate syndicates seeking to rebuild Terran imperialism. Their turning point was the **Helion Sector Insurrection of 2480**, where they seized control of the Jetgate and declared the sector their sovereign territory. This audacious move leveraged the Kryx Nebula’s turmoil as a smokescreen, solidifying their power.
