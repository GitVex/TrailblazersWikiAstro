## System Description 

The Albion system is the solar system closest to the **Gargantua Back Hole**, which houses the Jetgate of the Albion sector. Albion is a B1 type Supergiant star with 22 Solar Masses. The intense radiation from the star has turned most flora on the distant planet of **Celeste** into a reflective white color. This has attracted a lot of **religious** believers and cultural significance to the system, which mainly revolves around the planet Celeste, while most of the systems inhabitants live on the artificially shielded world of **Keregal** or on the immense Space Station orbiting the Gargantua Gate.

## Notable Events

This event solidified Celeste’s importance as a spiritual destination and led to the establishment of permanent shrines.
- **Lanternyard Inc. Expansion Dispute**: Several years ago, Lanternyard Inc. made a bid to control the Albion Orbital Port entirely. This led to a significant political standoff with the Unified Planets of Sol, resulting in a compromise but leaving lingering tensions.

## Adventure Hooks 

- **Relics of the Forest**: Devotees on Celeste speak of relics hidden deep within the White Forests, remnants of an ancient civilization that revered the supergiant. Adventurers are offered a sizable sum to locate one of these relics for a private collector—but the religious community may not take kindly to outsiders disturbing sacred ground.
- **Trade Route Disruption**: Traders between Cephei and Albion Orbital Port report growing issues with “phantom” gravitational forces disrupting navigational systems. A deeper investigation reveals the potential manipulation of local gravity fields, perhaps connected to Lanternyard’s secretive research on Cephei.

## Additional Details 

**Cultural Aspects**: Pilgrims to Celeste often participate in the “Radiant Rebirth” ceremony, which involves wearing white robes and walking through the white forests, symbolizing purification. This ritual has become a common practice even among non-believers, as many visit Celeste simply to experience the surreal landscape.
