## System Description 

The **Coross System** orbits **A-1147**, a medium-sized, stable yellow star that has been central to trade within the Albion sector for centuries. Known for its strategic location, Coross has attracted attention as an essential hub for commerce and logistics, with highly automated infrastructure and the ancient, self-sustaining Unilog VI that facilitates nearly all operations within the system. The system is a crossroads of trade routes, making it vital to the Unified Planets of Sol. Environmental conditions on Coross Minor are harsher due to thin atmospheric protection, while the Coross Trade Complex maintains its own controlled environments, adapted to off-world visitors.

## Notable Events 

- **The Unilog Protocol Conflict**: Fifty years ago, a faction attempted to override Unilog’s protocols to gain control over trade routes. The VI responded by shutting down all non-essential systems and locking out foreign access for nearly a month, nearly collapsing the system’s economy.
- **The Expansion of Coross Minor**: As trade increased, a second phase of infrastructure expanded Coross Minor’s Trade Authority, creating more docking bays and administrative stations. This led to an influx of settlers, many of whom now maintain the system’s operations.

## Adventure Hooks 

- **The Unilog Artifact**: A rare pretech component has been discovered within the Primary Logistics Matrix, triggering interest from factions both within and outside the system. Smugglers, hackers, and even government agents race to recover or neutralize it.
- **Signal of the Lost**: Deep in Coross Minor, a strange distress signal from an abandoned sector has begun broadcasting. Traders suspect a forgotten AI core might hold valuable pretech data – but getting there means braving both system hazards and rogue robots.
- **The Heist of Coross**: A notorious gang plans to infiltrate the Coross Orbital Station to access a pretech vault. The Trade Authority seeks undercover operatives to stop the heist without causing panic among the station’s visitors.

## Additional Details 

**Unilog’s Last Directive**: Legends among traders hint that Unilog was tasked with a “last directive” upon its activation. This directive remains a mystery, but some believe it may involve the return of the original builders or an ancient objective yet to be realized.
