## Planetary Description 

Coross is one giant Logistics hub, controlled by a pretech VI that no one really understands. The VI doesn't really care who trades with and on it, it just does. The world is only populated by Robots who facilitate the trading logistics, though there are pressurized Bazar areas where off-worlders can trade face-to-face. Also has massive orbital installations that can dock Freightliners.

### Unilog Primary Mind
The Unilog Primary Mind is an ancient pretech VI rumored to be built by the same race as the Jetgates. It facilitates the Trade Operations that hold up the surrounding systems and the entirety of the Northern Sweep Trade Lane. It certainly is an uncontrollable factor, but there is little to be done against that despite the best efforts of the humans of the Coross Trade Authority

- **Missing Shipment**: An advanced cargo freighter carrying rare pretech artifacts has mysteriously gone off course. The Coross Trade Authority is offering a bounty to any crew willing to track it down.
- **The VI’s Secret**: Rumors circulate that Unilog might be capable of comprehending and making decisions far beyond known protocols. A high-ranking trading faction secretly funds a team to determine if Unilog is self-aware.
