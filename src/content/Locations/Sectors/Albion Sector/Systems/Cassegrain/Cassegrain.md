## Planetary Description 

Cassegrain is a lush, tropical world of vibrant, humid **jungles** and sprawling landscapes where biocybernetic animals thrive alongside human Nomad tribes. Known for its natural beauty and rich biodiversity, the planet is dotted with thick canopies, winding rivers, and bioluminescent flora that illuminate the undergrowth by night. The tribes have adapted to the environment by embracing its rhythms rather than attempting to tame it. Most inhabitants are off-worlders drawn by the legend of a crashed **O'Neill Cylinder**—a massive, pretech space habitat rumored to hold vast technological secrets. Although they’ve adopted certain modern vehicles and tools for traversing dense jungles, the tribes exercise caution, trying not to disrupt the fragile ecosystem. However, outsiders and **Cyber Poachers** pose a continual threat, seeking to exploit the planet’s biocybernetic creatures and push deeper into Nomad territory in search of untold riches.

| Nature              | The population quickly realized that living with nature was a better alternative to trying to tame it.                                 |

## Notable Locations 

|**Location**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|The Marker|A massive stone pillar engraved with pretech symbols, considered sacred by the Nomads, thought to mark the location of the crashed O'Neill Cylinder.|
|The Swamp of Lost Lights|A treacherous marshland illuminated by bioluminescent flora; it’s rumored that some of the more dangerous fauna in Cassegrain lurk here, hunting anything that stumbles in.|
**The Swamp of Lost Lights**: This swamp attracts both explorers and adventurers. Lumiferns, along with smaller lights scattered throughout, create an almost hypnotic glow. However, venturing too far can be fatal as cyber-poachers use the area as a base to avoid Nomadic patrols, and especially aggressive kinds of cyberanimals roam this area.

**The Marker**: The tribes believe the Marker is an ancient waypoint, leading the way to the elusive O'Neill Cylinder. Some off-worlders think it's merely a monument left by earlier settlers, but the Nomads insist it has deeper significance.

## Major Conflicts 

|**Conflict Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|The Nomads vs. Cyber Poachers|An ongoing struggle as the Cyber Poachers encroach on Nomad territory to capture and sell augmented animals. The Nomads resist, seeking to preserve the delicate balance of their ecosystem.|
|Tribal Disputes|Disagreements among the Nomads themselves over how best to approach the search for the O'Neill Cylinder, with some favoring secrecy and others advocating for off-world help.|
- **The Nomads vs. Cyber Poachers**: The Nomads view the poachers as disruptive and dangerous, as their methods not only harm the creatures but also risk ecosystem collapse. Some Nomads have taken to ambushing poachers, using traps and guerrilla tactics in defense.
- **Tribal Disputes**: A schism is forming within the Nomadic tribes over the search for the Cylinder. Some believe opening the search to outside aid could speed up the process, while others fear it would lead to exploitation and loss of the Cylinder’s secrets.

## Adventure Hooks 

- **The Marker's Secret**: A respected Nomad elder claims to have had a vision revealing a hidden message within The Marker’s carvings. The tribe needs help deciphering it, but the Cyber Poachers have also taken an interest, believing the Marker might hold a valuable map.
- **Rescue in the Swamp**: A young Nomad scout has gone missing in the Swamp of Lost Lights while tracking a group of Cyber Poachers. The tribe is offering a reward for anyone willing to brave the spore-filled swamp to find him.
- **Strange Augmentations**: Rumors circulate about strange, out-of-place cybernetics found on some animals that hint at someone experimenting on the fauna. The Nomads want off-world help to investigate, as the culprit may be operating in areas they can’t reach without risking their way of life.
