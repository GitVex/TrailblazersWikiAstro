## System Description 

The Polaris system, centered around the anomalous proto-star A-0400, is unique for scientific endeavors and a rarity in the galaxy. Known informally as "The Star That Doesn’t Shine," A-0400 is a Y-class star with a lightless, radiation-absorbing mantle—a **radiophage**. Its surface appears as an eerie, dark mass against the cosmos, absorbing heat, light, and electromagnetic waves within a close radius. Peculiarly, this effect only seems to effect emissions originating from inside the system, but radiation from outside is undisturbed. This odd property has drawn the attention of researchers and corporations, making Polaris a critical site for deep space **observation**, shielded from the light pollution of typical star systems.

| Sehwana Deep Space Observatory | Space Station | The Sehwana Deep Space Observatory is the main hub for researchers in the Polaris system, placed in orbit of Polaris III. Sehwana is equipped with advanced sensors and labs to profit off the absence of cosmic interference. The station has tight security and state-of-the-art equipment, attracting top researchers and occasionally, corporate spies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Coreolis Rift                  | Anomaly       | Anomaly on the surface of A-0400, appearing as a tear in the fabric of space itself, faintly visible against the darkness of A-0400. The Coreolis Rift has a unique gravitational signature and periodically emits bursts of exotic particles. Ships approaching the Rift often report strange sensor readings and unexplained power fluctuations, sparking theories that it might be an unstable wormhole or a gateway to another dimension. Both scientific and corporate interests are keen to explore its mysteries, though no ship has yet successfully crossed through. |

| Electromagnetic Absorbtion Zone | Due to the radiophage's radiation-absorbing properties, vessels within a certain radius experience signal blackouts and unreliable communication. |
| Dark Matter Flux                | Unstable pockets of dark matter occasionally form around Polaris, creating gravitational anomalies that can throw off ship trajectories.          |

## Notable Events 

**The Polaris Rift Incident**: A deep-space vessel conducting close-range scans of A-0400 disappeared without explanation, leading to an increase in corporate security protocols and a ban on unauthorized exploration near the radiophage.

## Adventure Hooks 

- **Corporate Espionage Race**: Danube Research Corp. is rumored to have hidden a covert data collection device within Sehwana Observatory. Players may be hired by either Archivo Urkantone to uncover the spy device or by Danube Corp. to protect their asset.
- **The Dark Matter Run**: A rogue trader claims to have mapped stable pockets of dark matter within the Polaris system, selling these “safe routes” for a high price. The players must test the legitimacy of these routes, facing potential hazards and competition from rival researchers.

## Additional Details 

- **Unexplored Ruins**: Deep within Polaris III’s southern hemisphere lies a strange, abandoned outpost of unknown origin. Research teams have begun expeditions to understand its purpose, and rumors circulate that the structure predates even the known galactic civilizations.
- **Exotic Flora**: Polarized bioluminescent fungi are rumored to grow in specific asteroid belts in the system. These fungi absorb ambient radiation from A-0400 and may hold the key to breakthroughs in radiation-resistant crops.
