## System Description 
Titanis was the first system colonized in Albion by the [[UPS Loreley]]. Originally, The UPS Loreley was supposed to reach the [[Cassegrain System]], but was necessary to crash land on Titania due to a heavy Ion Storm that rowed through Albion at the time. Lacking infrastructure for a rescue mission in the Sector, the Loreley's inhabitants saw themselves forced to settle on the Planet, as they waited for the storm to blow over the region. This would not come to pass for another 6 years though, until which Titania was a proper colony.

When the storm lifted, the inhabitants were eager to take up their original route again, but got told that a second ship, the [[UPS Irihoga]] had already made landfall in the system. Now, there is a cultural and societal grudge against the people living on Cassegrain, as well as the government of [[Lucido System|Lucido]], which was the colonial government at the time and the origin of the Irihoga.

Titania is a biodiverse ocean locked beneath a frozen desert. Cities are build underwater and look like they were built upside down from the ceiling ice.
