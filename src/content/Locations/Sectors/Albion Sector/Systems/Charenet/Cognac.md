## Planetary Description 

Cognac is a small, rocky moon orbiting Charenet, known primarily for its Pretech Spire. The Spire is less imposing than its counterpart on Charenet but is nonetheless a focal point for researchers from across the sector. The moon's surface is marked by frozen landscapes, scattered with metallic craters, suggesting ancient mining activity. Most of the population resides within **domed cities** or underground habitats, with infrastructure dedicated to supporting the researchers and scholars who study the Spire.
