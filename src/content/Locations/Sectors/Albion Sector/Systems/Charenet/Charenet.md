## Planetary Description 
Charenet is a metro-world, a planet blanketed by dense, sprawling urban environments interspersed with towering megastructures. At its heart lies the Charenet Spire, an enigmatic Pretech relic that serves as both a hub for scientific discovery and the headquarters for the Archivo Urkantone. The Driveyards dominate the skyline near Charenet's orbital elevators, producing the most advanced propulsion systems in the Albion sector. The planet's advanced infrastructure supports a thriving population with access to high-speed maglev networks, floating neighborhoods, and a culture deeply connected to starship production.
