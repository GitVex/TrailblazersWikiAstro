## System Description 

Anaris is a mostly barren system orbiting the G5 main sequence Star AL-7854. The main planetoid is closer to the sun than Earth and barely scrapes its goldilocks zone. Due to these intense circumstances, colonial efforts in the system were abandoned after a short trial period. For some reason though, the inhabitants did not want to leave and became fanatical about the moon of Anaris, which they named the "Will of God". Following a a series of incidents, most communication ceased from the planet and the colonists were left to their fate.
