### The Great Flood

#### Serpent Caravans
The Serpent Caravans are a loose confederation of **traders** who travel between settlements, **exchanging** small amounts of water, scavenged artifacts, preserved food, and makeshift equipment. They employ strict rituals and rely on a secretive blend of mild herbal concoctions and superstitions to **stave off madness** long enough to complete their routes. Their survival depends on their careful neutrality and the trust of local tribes. Their caravans are small and mobile, **avoiding** large gatherings to minimize exposure to both violence and the drone’s effects.

#### Followers of Zanius:  
A tightly knit cult led by the High Drowned, they pursue total religious unification across the region. Their rites involve drowning initiates in scarce water pools, a solemn ceremony believed to purify minds and stave off the worst of the drone’s effects. Communication outside their domain is nonexistent; the Followers rely on salvaged scraps of tradition and crude lore to guide them.
[[Anaris Statblocks#Blood Drinker Cultists|NPCs]]
#### Georgian Sects:  
Fanatics bent on gathering blood at any cost, they operate under the Whispered One’s strict command. With no outside technology, their crude methods involve blood-siphoning devices made from bone and scrap metal. They cling to the promise of divine floods, using relentless faith as a bulwark against drone-induced madness. Medieval Style.

#### Blood Drinkers:  
A savage tribe led by Chieftain Drinker, they rely on human flesh as both sustenance and ritual. Isolated from any higher-tech influence, they share whispered folk cures—muttered charms, body paint, and rhythmic chants—to maintain a tenuous mental balance.

## Notable Locations 

| **Location**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| City of a Thousand Screams | Colonial Urban Area which stretches over a large area of the south-eastern Quadrant of the Planet. Not occupied as once the drone sets in, the further you come to the origin it hurts more. |
| Palace of Blood            | Seat of the Georgian Sects. Collection of tents and shamly structures around an old colonial structure, comparable in size to a medieval city.                                               |
### Northern Dunelands
The Northern Dunelands are a barren expanse of shifting sands and jagged rocky outcrops that dominate the northern hemisphere of Anaris. Life here is harsh and unforgiving, with searing temperatures during the day and biting cold at night. Tribes that inhabit this region rely on ancient wells and hidden aquifers to survive, and they are fiercely territorial. A few skeletal remains of colossal pretech machinery, reach half-buried out of the sand, long forgotten and scavenged over generations. Sandstorms sweep across the Dunelands with relentless force, often erasing paths and swallowing entire caravans.

### The Crater Oasis
![[The Crater Oasis#Description]]

### City of a Thousand Screams

Once a bustling colonial metropolis, the City of a Thousand Screams is now a sprawling, desolate ghost town in the southern hemisphere. The closer one gets to its heart, the stronger the maddening drone becomes, driving most intruders insane before they can uncover its mysteries. Buildings crumble under the weight of time and neglect, and streets are overrun by the creeping desert sands. Despite its dangers, scavengers risk everything to plunder the city’s relics, hoping to strike pretech treasures.

### The Dry Jungle

Contrasting with the arid Dunelands, the Dry Jungle of the southern hemisphere is an eerie labyrinth of petrified trees and skeletal vegetation. Life here clings to anything with a slither of moisture, with flora and fauna that siphons water out of anything it can get a hold of. The Palace of Blood, the seat of the Georgian Sects, sits in the city of Ramunpatra, surrounded by sprawling encampments of fanatical devotees. The jungle’s cracked, dusty ground hides an intricate network of caverns and tunnels where ancient secrets and horrors dwell.

| Southern Territory War | Battles over the few water sources of the south between the southern tribes of the Georgian Sect and the cannibals of the Blood Drinkers.                                                                  |

## Adventure Hooks 

- **The Pulse of Madness**: A malfunctioning pretech device is spreading “Insanity Drones,” causing erratic behavior in a nearby settlement. The locals believe it is a message from the water god and are unwilling to let outsiders disable it.
- **The Forgotten Vault**: Legends tell of a buried pretech vault in the Forbidden Lands holding technology that could cure the madness. However, few have ventured close without succumbing to the drone’s effects.
- **Blood Pact**: A smaller cult has recently uncovered an old pretech generator. They are willing to trade this relic for enough blood to rival the power of God's Anointed, sparking a deadly collection spree.

## Additional Details 

- **The Will of God Moon**: The local moon, visible even during daylight hours, is central to the belief of the Great Flood. A rare eclipse, known as “The Drowning Sky,” is a holy event.
- **Relic Markings**: Inhabitants tattoo their skin with pretech symbols, believing these markings protect them from “droned” madness.
