## Description 

The Crater Oasis is a sprawling settlement located within a massive impact crater in the arid Northern Dunelands. A rare source of fresh water in the otherwise barren region, the oasis has become a critical hub for survival on Anaris. The settlement is dominated by makeshift dwellings, cultivated plots of hardy crops, and religious monuments to the Great Flood. 

The settlement’s bustling market is a chaotic blend of trade and fervent devotion, with blood-stained rituals and water exchanges occurring side by side. The atmosphere is tense, as armed guards patrol the streets and watch for signs of rebellion or outside incursions.

The Georgian Sects currently control the area, but the oasis remains a focal point of intense conflict, as other factions constantly vie for its resources.
