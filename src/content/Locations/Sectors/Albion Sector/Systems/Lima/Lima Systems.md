## System Description 

The **Lima Systems** were part of the second wave of colonization in Albion. The **seat of the regional government** was moved here because of the system's cultural and strategic importance. The binary stars which make up this system orbit themselves at an extrem distance, approx.. 3000 AU. Lima Major is a K0 V main-sequence star which houses most of the binary systems population in its inner planets, shielded by a magnetized Asteroid belt from the x-ray radiation of its sister star, Lima Minor. Lima Minor is a **Pulsar** with an exact rotation time of 134ms, which has led to its adoption as a stellar navigational beacon. Surrounding Lima Minor are 5 planets which appear to be lifeless, though some scientific exploration has shown that they may have once harbored life as indicated by ruins, mining scars and debris fields.

| Lima Minor Pulsar | On approach to the Lima Major System, the pulsing signals of Lima Minor can blind sensors and minorly inhibit navigation in certain stellar seasons. |
| Cartel Activity   | Recent reports indicate an increase in interactions between the Free People of Badigo and the [[Jitai Cartel]]                                       |

## Notable Events 

- **Stranding of the UPS Manitoba**: During the colonization of Lima Major, a cargo hauler turned off-course through the interference of the nearby Pulsar and ended up in its near vicinity. The radiation quickly knocked out the unshielded systems of the hauler, rendering it unable to evade and eventually crash on the third of the 5 barren worlds surrounding the neutron star. Since then galactic standards on circuit shielding have been adjusted. Though some star farers still superstitiously reboot their navigational sensors after entering the pulsar's sphere of influence to recalibrate their sensitivity, even if this is done automatically in most modern systems.
- **Cartel Takeover of Arunov**: Before Lanternyard's large presence on the Moon, an alliance of local crime syndicates sparked a coup against the planetary government. This was partly successful at the time until the involvement of multiple sector and galactic institutions with a large involvement of Lanternyard and SecCom Security personnel. To this day, it is unsure how many politicians and planetary offices are influenced by criminal factions.

## Adventure Hooks 

- **Politics on a Thin Atmosphere**: The balance of power on Arunov is fragile. Lanternyard Inc. seeks assistance in securing information on corrupt officials linked to the Free People of Badigo. Meanwhile, the cartel might offer a counter-deal, promising resources or information on valuable artifacts in the asteroid belt.
- **The "Manitoba" Relic**: Rumors circulate about the UPS Manitoba carrying pretech artifacts in its cargo when it crashed. Adventurers could take on a dangerous salvage mission to recover these artifacts while contending with deteriorating conditions and the ghostly reputation of the site.
