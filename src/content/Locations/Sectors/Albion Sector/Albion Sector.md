## Sector Description 

**Albion**, also known as the "New Sol" sector, is a jewel of the Unified Planets of Sol. Being a major hot spot of Human colonization after the discovery of the Albion Jetgate, the sector quickly grew in all categories such as economy and culture. During the Gate Wars, Albion was a major refuge for people coming from the galactic south, which makes it a melting pot for all kinds of people around the galaxy.

Today, Albion is still the second most notable sector of the **Unified Planets**, right after Gaia. Though under the welcoming posters and flyers that keep a face of serenity in Albion, political corruption and the rise of corporate overreach has given way to a rapidly developing underworld of criminals and revolutionaries that scurry for power right under the bureaucracy-locked UPoS.
