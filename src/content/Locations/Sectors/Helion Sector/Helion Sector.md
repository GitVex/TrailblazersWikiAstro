## Sector Description 

The Helion sector was not originally part of the Unified Planets of Sol. It's Jetgate was discovered by independent adventurers during the First Gate War. Official Colonization efforts were not made due to a lack of urgency and resources during wartime. Instead, private operations lead to most of the now developed worlds in the sector.

After the war, the independent sector of Helion saw an influx in Agents and Operatives from the Terran Empire, seeking to establish Bases of Operation in the sector to put pressure on the bordering Albion sector and the UPoS as a whole. A political skirmish ensued over the course of a decade with UP and Imperial delegations vying for support in the House of Representatives on Apollo, which ultimately sided with the adjacent Unified Planets, ending military ambitions of the Empire, shortly before the start of the Second Gate War.

In a surprise to the galaxy, the splinter group One Earth Government, which is an Imperial Remnant after the [[Terran Civil War]], captured the Helion Jetgate and brought the sector under their rule with a fleet of modernized Terran Empire Ships, which have been discretely moved to unknown systems in the galactic north.
