# Ship: LF-2500 "Lancelot"

## Class Overview 

| **Class**        | Freighter            |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| **Role**         | Short Range Delivery |
| **Manufacturer** | [[Parromax Cargo]]   |

The Lancelot Class is a more versatile, smaller-scale freighter for operations that don't require the massive cargo capacity of the AC-2000. Ideal for independent traders, small colonies, and intra-system transport, the Lancelot balances speed, cargo space, and operational costs effectively.

Lancelot Freighters are often complements of Freightliners as berthed delivery ships to fulfill orders for systems adjacent to the main jetgate port, but are just as often seen as independent ships for intra- and inter-system transports.
