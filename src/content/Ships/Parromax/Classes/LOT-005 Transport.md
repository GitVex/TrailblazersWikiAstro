# Ship: LOT-005 "Liner" Transport

## Overview 

| **Class**        | Freighter            |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| **Role**         | Short-Warp Freighter |
| **Manufacturer** | [[Parromax Cargo]]   |

The **Line Operated Transport** (LOT) was often called the "Lifeline of the Colony" during the Expansion Era of the Unified Planets. Since Lanternyard's Freightliners were not designed to operate outside of one or two systems adjacent to a Jetgate, another ship jumped to the task in the form of the Liner Transport.

Liner's are primarily used on predetermined flight paths between major distribution centers and starports. Since a major breakthrough in **VI** research in 2440, most Liner's operate with a single VI as it's captain, cutting down on crew costs immensely. Though, almost all still possess a physical bridge as the VI is retrofitted into the ship's system.
