# Ship: Armored Fast Atmospheric Transport (AFAT) Cargo Shuttle

## Overview 

| **Class**        | Freighter                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Role**         | Cargo Ferrying and System Transport |
| **Manufacturer** | [[Parromax Cargo]]                  |

The AFAT is the smaller and cheaper predecessor to the LF-2500. During the early years of interstellar travel, it was the backbone of Trade between Earth and its colonies. Today it sees use in the more outlying systems and poorly incorporated regions of space. It fills the role of a cargo ferry for minor starports that do not need to deal with huge non-continuous throughputs and mainly focus on supplying a minor colony or a few outposts.

As especially these locations have bee subject to an increased rate of piracy and marauding, Parromax retrofitted most of the iterations with a tougher armor and an armory.

## Operational History 

The Armored Fast Atmospheric Transport (AFAT) Cargo Shuttle was first introduced by **Parromax Cargo** in 2247 to address the logistical challenges of operating in fringe systems with limited infrastructure. The shuttle quickly gained popularity for its robust design, which allowed it to endure harsh environments and occasional skirmishes with pirates.

Since the dawn of high-capacity transports and other this ship being designed for a completely different paradigm, the AFAT became a lesser seen sight on major trade routes, but more so seen in those fringe system, where it can still fulfil its intended purpose.
