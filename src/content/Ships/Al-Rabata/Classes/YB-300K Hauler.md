# Ship: YB-300K "Mule" Hauler
## Overview 

| **Class**        | Mining Ship                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Role**         | Mining & Salvage                   |
| **Manufacturer** | [[Al-Rabata\|Al-Rabata Shipyards]] |

The Mule hauler is a specific type of spacecraft designed for freelance mining and scavenging operations. The ship holds quarters for a crew of 10. With a length of just over 85m the internal walkways and living spaces are quite cramped to make more space for cargo holds and equipment storage. Large airlock doors allow for easy atmospheric exchange of heavy equipment and depressurizable holds can open their doors while scavengers ferry debris and other valuables.

## Operational History 
The YB-300K was introduced during an Al-Rabata mining Operation in cooperation with the [[Confederacy of Terran Gates]]. The Operation turned out to be a sluggish unremarkable performance as troubles with conflicting local authorities halted mining processes. Since this debacle the Mule has seen extensive use as a freelancing ship and in smaller system mining companies, after Al-Rabata Shipyards had to sell off the stock of ships meant for bigger buyers at a cheaper price.
