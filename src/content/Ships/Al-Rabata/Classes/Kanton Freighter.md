# Ship: Kanton

## Overview 

| **Class**        | Freighter                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Role**         | Point-to-Point Hauler              |
| **Manufacturer** | [[Al-Rabata\|Al-Rabata Shipyards]] |

The Kanton class was an evolution of multiple pragmatic designs that converted older classes of bulk freighters that hauled goods from Alpha Centauri to Earth, into an all-rounder that can carry both general and bulk goods. They are primarily used to service far off mining operations and as transfer vehicles.

## Story Hooks 

- **Sabotaged Shipment**: A shipment aboard a Kanton-class was tampered with. Was it corporate espionage, piracy, or something else?
- **Upgrade Dilemma**: A captain is looking to retrofit their Kanton-class freighter for long-haul trips into the Kryx Nebula but needs rare materials.

## Additional Details 

The Kanton class is known for its reliability but lacks the finesse of newer designs. Its modular build allows it to be adapted for niche roles, making it popular among independent contractors and smaller mining operations. However, its lack of advanced automation means it requires a larger crew compared to modern equivalents, adding to operational costs.
