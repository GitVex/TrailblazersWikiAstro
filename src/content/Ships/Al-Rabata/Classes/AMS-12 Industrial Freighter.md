# Ship: AMS-12 Industrial Freighter

## Class Overview 

| **Class**        | Freighter                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Role**         | Bulk / Liquid Freighter                                |
| **Manufacturer** | [[Parromax Cargo]], [[Al-Rabata\|Al-Rabata Shipyards]] |

The **AMS-12 Industrial Freighter** is a joint development by Parromax Cargo and Al-Rabata, building on the proven [[LOT-005 Transport|LOT-005 "Liner" Transport]] chassis. Rather than using modular, external cargo scaffolding, the AMS-12 employs two massive, integrated cargo bays enclosed within reinforced bulkheads. This design provides superior handling of raw materials—be they bulk ore, unrefined metals, or large quantities of liquid commodities—while improving load stability and environmental control. These enclosed holds also simplify the loading process and ensure that cargo remains protected from vacuum exposure, temperature fluctuations, and potential debris hazards. Designed primarily for short-warp operations, the AMS-12 runs with a slim, VI-driven crew complement, lowering operational costs and expanding its utility across multiple mining outposts and industrial stations.

## Operational History 

The AMS-12 line was introduced around 2448 as Al-Rabata saw its breakthrough in **Microparticulate Harvesting**. Its two integrated, shielded cargo holds allowed for safer and more efficient transport of raw materials from asteroid mining operations and terrestrial strip mines to orbital refining stations. Over time, the AMS-12 has become a standard solution for companies that specialize in bulk material transport under hazardous conditions, such as high-radiation star systems or regions prone to micrometeorite activity.

## Story Hooks 

- **Corporate Competition:** A rival megacorp accuses Al-Rabata of patent infringement. The players might be asked to "acquire" technical specs from a docked AMS-12 for leverage in the ensuing legal battle.
- **Hazardous Cargo:** A malfunctioning environmental system threatens the integrity of the bulk liquid hold. The crew (or PCs) must scramble to repair it mid-journey before the cargo becomes volatile.
- **Hidden Contraband:** Rumors persist that certain operators retrofit AMS-12 holds to smuggle illicit goods. Authorities contract a crew of freelancers to discreetly inspect an AMS-12 in orbit over a frontier world.
