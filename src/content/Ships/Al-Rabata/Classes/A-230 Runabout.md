# Ship: A-230 "Rimskipper" Runabout

## Overview 

| **Class**        | Runabout                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Role**         | Exploration & Survey               |
| **Manufacturer** | [[Al-Rabata\|Al-Rabata Shipyards]] |

The Rimskipper Runabout was made as a **self-sufficient explorer** used in colonization and cartography efforts. It saw widespread use in the early development of the South Rim sector, and became a popular choice for independents and **freelancers** after most valuable systems within jetgate range had been mapped. Today, the ship can be seen throughout the galaxy in various shapes and forms, with their recognizable bow antennas and the cockpit canopy nestled between.

## Operational History 

The Rimskipper Runabout's story begins as a **workhorse** for the early colonization of the South Rim sector. Its rugged design and self-sufficient systems made it ideal for **long-duration surveys**, mapping uncharted systems, and **ferrying** essential supplies to outposts. As the frontier expanded, the A-230 was adopted by **independent explorers** and mercantile groups, serving roles from deep-space mining support to covert reconnaissance during territorial disputes. Numerous Rimskippers were retrofitted by freelancers, adding modular cargo holds, advanced sensor suites, or even weapon systems. Today, the vessel remains a versatile favorite, with many models still in active use decades after their initial launch.

## Typical Missions 

| **Mission Type**      | **Description**                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| South Rim Exploration | Rimskippers are periodically launching from South Rim to survey the frontier.                                                             |
| Nova Cygni Expedition | Employed by the Confederacy, Rimskippers are the mainstay of survey vessels roaming the Eastern fringes. Most contacts with the Sha'tazul |
| Private Vessel        | A-230 are relatively cheap for their performance, so are often used by tramps as privateer vessels                                        |

## Story Hooks 
**Lost Rimskipper**: An A-230 Rimskipper, the _Starfarer’s Folly_, disappeared during a high-priority Confederacy survey mission near a remote jetgate. Its last transmission hinted at an anomalous structure and unidentified signals. Finding the ship and its data could reveal a new frontier—or a lurking threat.
**Sha'tazul Contact**: A Rimskipper under Confederacy command made first contact with a Sha'tazul envoy at Nova Cygni. The crew vanished without a trace after transmitting cryptic recordings. Investigating the incident could unlock secrets about the enigmatic faction—or put the team in their crosshairs.
**Privateer in Peril**: An independent captain using a heavily modified Rimskipper has gone rogue, preying on Lanternyard Inc. shipping lanes. Lanternyard is offering a substantial bounty for its capture, but reports suggest the ship’s crew may be working under duress, raising ethical questions.
**Ancient Artefact**: A Rimskipper crew discovers an artifact of unknown origin during a routine survey. The object seems to resonate with the Jetgates, drawing attention from multiple factions. Keeping the artifact—or deciding who to sell it to—could have galactic repercussions.
