| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modular Ore-Refinement Unit   | A specialized on-board ore-processing system installed by corporate from a previous deployment where the Midgard had long haul times. Refining the cargo during transit cut down on downtime at the Refinery Station. The Unit is currently disabled. |
| Advanced Gravitic Stabilizers | High-end stabilization devices that ensure minimal cargo shifting, even when navigating hazardous asteroid fields or sudden gravitational shifts.                                                                                                     |
| Integrated Drone Launch Bay   | A compact bay housing half a dozen automated drones for external hull repairs, close-range survey tasks, and emergency salvage operations.                                                                                                            |

## Story Hooks 

- **A Hidden Manifest Entry:** During a routine cargo tally, the crew discovers an unlisted container with an encrypted seal. Is it contraband, secret data, or something more dangerous? The crew must decide whether to open it, report it, or quietly dispose of it.
- **Whispers from the VI:** The ship’s VI, “Hlaef,” occasionally emits unusual phrases and references historical events no one can recall. Unraveling this glitch could reveal that Hlaef’s core programming contains fragments of an ancient AI from the earliest days of Albion colonization.
- **The Missing Crewman:** A former engineer, rumored to have run off to join pirates, has suddenly resurfaced in the local network’s wanted bulletins. When the Midgard’s next cargo pickup aligns with this fugitive’s last known location, the crew faces a moral quandary: turn them in or use their knowledge to secure a more profitable deal.
- **Salvage of a Derelict Vessel:** In a remote sector of the Interro system, the Midgard picks up a distress beacon from a derelict ship long thought lost. Salvaging it could yield valuable technology—or awaken dangerous secrets better left buried.

## Additional Details 

The Midgard’s VI is nicknamed “Hlaef,” after an old Albion word for “sustenance".
