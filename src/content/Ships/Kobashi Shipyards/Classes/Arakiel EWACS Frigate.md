### Ship: Arakiel EWACS Frigate

## Class Overview 

| **Class**        | Frigate                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Role**         | EWACS, Patrol, Fleet Support |
| **Manufacturer** | [[Kobashi Shipyards]]        |

The Arakiel was a product of the Interwar arms race between the UPoS and the Terran Gates. To mitigate the immense cost and risks of deploying an "Alliance" Carrier to what would be patrol missions, the Naval Development Department on Earth developed a smaller ship. This ship enables the deployment of smaller numbers of ships along an Arakiel on forward patrol throughout the Kryx Nebula.

##### Defenses (Only on Military Ships)

| **Defense Type**     | **Description**                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Point Defense Lasers | +2 AC versus weapons that use ammo |
| Burst ECM Generator  | Negate one successful hit          |
| Drone Bay            | Carries 4 Mission Variable Drones  |
##### QuDAR
**Offensive Capabilities:**
1. **Stateful Tether Pinging:**  
    The Arakiel’s advanced sensor suite could use stateful tether pings to build highly detailed target images even in cluttered environments. By deploying a controlled burst of entangled particles, the frigate can precisely map a ship’s dimensions, detect faint hull signatures, and glean data that helps target weapon fire. This detailed data can then guide smart torpedoes or inform ECM countermeasures.
    
2. **Stateless Tether Pings in Combined Sensor Ops:**  
    The Arakiel may use low-effort stateless pings to rapidly sweep large sectors of space. These broad-stroke scans help confirm the presence of targets before the frigate commits to more resource-intensive stateful pings. Coupled with its networked systems, the Arakiel can hand off coordinates to nearby allies for pinpoint strikes.
    
3. **Quantum Entanglement Spoofing:**  
    By injecting carefully modulated quantum noise into the tether ping channel, the Arakiel can distort return signals from its own pings. This can confuse enemy attempts to detect the source of the scan or to gauge the Arakiel’s capabilities, making offensive operations stealthier and more deceptive.
    

**Defensive Capabilities:**

1. **Matter-Field Deployment:**  
    To counter hostile stateless tether scans, the Arakiel can deploy matter-dense countermeasures—clouds of reflective micro-particles launched from dedicated chutes. These form a barrier that limits the enemy’s ability to detect the frigate’s exact position via stateless tether pings.
    
2. **Quantum Signature Management:**  
    To guard against stateful tether mapping, the Arakiel’s ESM and ECM suites can generate controlled quantum fields or noise bursts that skew the entanglement signature. This makes the ship’s true dimensions and composition harder to resolve.
    
3. **Use of Environmental Cover:**  
    The Arakiel can maneuver into natural matter-dense fields—like nebulae or dust clouds—exploiting these environments to disrupt incoming tether pings. Even if the Arakiel cannot create these conditions on its own, its navigational agility and sensor awareness allow it to quickly find and exploit such cover.

## Operational History 

Developed during the Interwar period between the UPoS and the Terran Gates, the Arakiel allowed smaller, more cost-effective patrol missions into contested areas such as the Kryx Nebula.

| Reconnaissance Patrol | Conducting long-range surveillance in hostile zones.            |
| Fleet Support         | Providing ECM, SIGINT, and drone capabilities to allied fleets. |
##### Fleet Operational Tasks
- **Coordinating** drone-based reconnaissance sweeps of contested sectors.
- **Jamming** and disrupting enemy communications or sensor arrays.

- Overseeing **electronic warfare strikes** to confuse or mislead hostile forces.
- Serving as a forward **observation platform**, relaying up-to-date tactical data to command.
- Operating as a node in **network-centric** warfare, helping synchronize multi-ship strikes.

## Story Hooks 

- A lost Arakiel vessel's black box reveals classified data that could tip the balance in the Kryx Nebula Cold War.
- Lanternyard Inc. engineers are sent to upgrade the Arakiel’s sensors, but sabotage may be involved.
- An Arakiel frigate crew uncovers a Sha'tazul artifact during a routine patrol, sparking a race between factions to claim it.
