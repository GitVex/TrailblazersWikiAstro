# Ship: "Dumah" Guided Missile Cruiser

## Class Overview 

| **Class**        | Cruiser                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Role**         | Strategic / Tactical Strike Capability |
| **Manufacturer** | [[Kobashi Shipyards]]                  |

The Dumah is a UPoS warship designed to strategically engage key targets in a larger formation of enemy vessels such as command, supply or communication ships.

It's low frontal profile and radar absorbant coating coupled with its immense operation range enable it to stay largely undetected during engagements. It is therefore only lightly armored and equipped with self-defense weaponry.

## Operational History 

The Dumah class was first deployed in small numbers during the mid-24th century. It saw action in the Skarion Frontier Incursion and the subsequent Orion Rift standoffs, participating in covert strikes against enemy supply lines. As the UPoS expanded its sphere of influence, Dumah-class cruisers continued to serve as pivotal assets, conducting long-range strikes and ensuring the strategic neutralization of enemy command vessels.

## Story Hooks 

Whispers circulate that a Dumah-class cruiser, presumed lost, has been spotted far beyond charted space. Rumor has it the vessel carries critical data on a deep space phenomena or a new Terran Offensive.

## Additional Details 
The Dumah’s bridge relies heavily on advanced automation and sensor integration, reducing crew workload and improving tactical response times. The ship’s hull includes dedicated maintenance shafts and access points, enabling rapid in-field repairs and subsystem overhauls.
