## Operational History 

The *Lantoniaian* has a long but checkered operational history, bouncing from corporate ownership to independent hands. Once part of a Unified Planets relief fleet, the ship was sold off after sustaining damage in an unnamed border skirmish. Since then, it has survived countless black market runs, engagements with pirates, and several near misses with critical accidents. Its current crew has operated it for three years.

## Story Hooks 

- **The Graffiti’s Message**  
    A cryptic message hidden beneath the "Free Badigo" graffiti hints at the location of a forgotten cache in a war-torn system. Was this intentional or an oversight from a hurried paint job?
    
- **Courier in Trouble**  
    The ship has been hired to deliver a mysterious lockbox to **Albion Trade Orbital**. Rival factions have caught wind of the job, and someone’s after the cargo—or the crew.
    
- **Shipyard Debt**  
    Kane Varo still owes a hefty debt to the New Titania Shipyard. A debt collector from **Lanternyard Inc.** offers a way out: one risky delivery through **disputed Terran Empire space**.

## Additional Details 

- The ship’s galley still has an **unopened crate** labeled “Gourmet MREs – Expiry 25 Years Ago.” No one’s dared to try one yet.
- Hidden along a bulkhead is a scratched **inscription**: _"To Ziri, fly free—wherever stars dare."_ Who Ziri was remains a mystery to the current crew.
