## Operational History 

The SPL Arca Planetae has a long-standing role as a critical vessel on the Orion Funnel Trade Route, ferrying bulk cargo and freighters for S. Pace Logistics. The vessel was built in the Charenet Shipyards and is homeported at the Voronis Sector Trade Orbital.

On May 18, 2453, the Arca Planetae became embroiled in a high-profile incident involving a group of fugitive bounty hunters. The ship was unexpectedly commandeered during their escape from local authorities at the Gargantua Orbital Port. The trio accessed the vessel through its idling fuel lines and undocked it from the station, using its tug systems as a temporary escape vehicle.

Stranded due to insufficient fuel, the Arca Planetae was left marooned in a precarious orbit near Gargantua. The situation required a months-long cleanup operation to stabilize the vessel and prevent it from succumbing to the gravitational pull of the nearby black hole. After being relocated to a less hazardous region of space, the Arca Planetae was refueled and returned to the Charenet Shipyards for a thorough inspection and repairs.

This incident has since become a point of contention for S. Pace Logistics, Lanternyard Inc., and local authorities. The Arca Planetae continues to serve as a cornerstone of interstellar trade, albeit with tightened security measures.
