## Operational History 

Ariadne Corvettes were extensively utilized during the Second Gate War, often assigned to critical reconnaissance missions that paved the way for **larger fleet movements**. Their high-endurance systems allowed them to spend **weeks in hostile territories**, gathering **intelligence** on enemy fleet movements and infrastructure. After the war, many Ariadne Corvettes were stationed in the Kryx Nebula Fields, **monitoring** unregulated gate travel and acting as first responders to pirate incursions. Notably, one squadron of Ariadne Corvettes thwarted a major smuggling operation in the outer regions of UPoS territory by deploying advanced sensor tactics and precision strikes.
