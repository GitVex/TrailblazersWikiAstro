## Operational History 

The SSBx-02 "Firewatch" has participated in multiple engagements along the Betelgeuse frontier, providing orbital artillery support during planetary assaults and serving as a command hub for surface operations. Its presence has been a decisive factor in securing beachheads and maintaining supply lines in contested territories.

In the tense years of the Kryx Nebula Cold War, the Firewatch and sister SSB-class vessels have been deployed as both deterrents and strategic assets. Often stationed in high orbit above contested worlds, they function as "watchtowers"—overseeing peace treaties, monitoring neutral trade routes, and silently reminding regional powers of the Terran Hegemony’s influence. In certain "diplomatic missions," the arrival of an SSB can act as a subtle nudge for planetary governments to engage in negotiations on Terran terms.

## Typical Missions 

| **Mission Type**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Planetary Beachhead Invasion  | The Firewatch provides heavy orbital fire support and rapid-deployment drop pods, allowing allied ground forces to establish secure landing zones on hostile worlds.                                     |
| Orbital Siege & Blockade      | Positioned in geostationary orbit, the vessel enforces planetary blockades, interdicting incoming/outgoing traffic, performing targeted strikes against defenses, and applying pressure until surrender. |
| Extended Garrison & Overwatch | The ship remains on station for months—or years—acting as a logistics hub, medical facility, and forward radar base. It supports ongoing ground campaigns and helps maintain a Terran foothold.          |

## Story Hooks 

- **Sabotage on the Firewatch:** Rumors suggest that a high-ranking officer has been compromised by a rival power. A series of "maintenance mishaps" aboard the Firewatch threaten critical systems just before a major invasion. The PCs must root out spies and avert disaster before enemy troops on the surface gain the upper hand.
    
- **Hostage Diplomacy:** The Firewatch orbits an independent world undergoing tense peace talks. When dignitaries are taken hostage planetside, the ship’s command must balance brute force rescue attempts with delicate diplomacy. The PCs might join infiltration teams or handle negotiations, as the enemy dares them to risk civilian lives.
    
- **Treasure of the Frontier:** A hidden vault deep in the Firewatch’s cargo holds contains ancient alien relics—booty from a long-forgotten campaign. As a strange energy begins to affect crew morale and onboard systems, the PCs scramble to contain the artifact’s influence before mutiny or madness breaks out.
    
- **Against the Clock:** The Firewatch’s short-warp core fails in the midst of a crucial redeployment, trapping it behind enemy lines. With hostiles closing in, the crew must initiate emergency repairs, bargain with rogue traders, and call in old favors. The PCs could be tasked with securing vital warp field components on a hostile moon below.

## Additional Details 

All SSB-class vessels, is designed to carry Terran Special Forces Mechanized Infantry divisions. These elite troops utilize advanced Mech Suits—bipedal armored walkers suited for urban combat and hazardous environments. Deployed from specialized launch bays, these mechanized units form the spearhead of planetary assaults, leading charges through twisting city streets or dense jungle terrain. They rely on the Firewatch’s orbital overwatch for timely recon data, pinpoint artillery strikes, and rapid resupply, ensuring that ground campaigns maintain momentum even under the harshest conditions.
