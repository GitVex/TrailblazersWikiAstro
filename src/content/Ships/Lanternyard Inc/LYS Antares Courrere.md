## Operational History 

The Antares had a relatively calm history, flying it's usually routes up and down from Helion to Thalassa. Until it got ripped from superlightspeed between Albion and Aveterni while travelling from [[Suegra System|Suegra]], where it underwent a refit, back to Albion. The crew was able to fend off the small pirate fleet and subsequently liberated the Crew of the Urukome, a Freighter that the pirates captured in the [[Lambda Velorum System]].

This incident set the precedent for Grav-Yanking, which is pirate slang for utilizing a modified gravity anchor, which are only found on Jetgate-Rated Lanternyard vessels, to slow a ship prematurely out of its inertia.
