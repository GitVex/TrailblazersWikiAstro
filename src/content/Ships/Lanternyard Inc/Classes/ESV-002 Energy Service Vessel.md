# Ship: ESV-002 "Aurora" Energy Service Vessel

## Class Overview 

| **Class**        | Freighter                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Role**         | Energy Service             |
| **Manufacturer** | [[Lanternyard Nullcrafts]] |

The ESV-002 is frequently used as a "Battery Ship", servicing deep space installations that can't rely on their own power source. Given that most stations are either in range of a star or are large enough to house their own power plant, this ship's application is pretty niche. Even so, it still sees use in special deployments—such as supporting high-power scientific arrays in the [[Polaris System]] or maintaining energy supply clusters deep inside the [[Kryx Nebula Fields]], where local conditions make independent power generation inefficient or hazardous.

## Operational History 

Originally commissioned to supply remote scientific outposts and specialized relay stations, the Aurora class saw limited production runs due to its niche purpose. However, the few hulls that were built have continuously proven their value in hard-to-reach locales, from carrying backup power banks through the Polaris ice fields to supporting low-orbit surveying platforms within the Kryx Nebula. Their reputation for reliability, even in harsh conditions, has earned them a small but loyal customer base among frontier researchers and private contractors.

## Typical Missions 

| **Mission Type**        | **Description**                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Remote Satellite Supply | Delivering rechargeable power cores to scientific or communications satellites in deep space regions.                |
| Emergency Power Support | Providing temporary energy support to malfunctioning or lightly damaged stations lacking fully operational reactors. |
| Frontier Power Escort   | Provides Emergency Power Support to long colony or deep space missions.                                              |

## Story Hooks 

- **Strange Energy Readings**: A routine supply run encounters unexpected energy surges in a remote nebula station. Is it a reactor malfunction, or something more mysterious lurking nearby?
- **Lost in the Kryx Nebula**: The ship’s sensor arrays pick up faint signals from an old research probe presumed lost decades ago. Its power signature might just lead to lucrative salvage—or hidden dangers.
