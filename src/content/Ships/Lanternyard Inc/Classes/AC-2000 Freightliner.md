# Ship Class: Freightliner

## Overview 

| **Class**        | Superfreighter                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Role**         | Long Range Freighter                         |
| **Manufacturer** | [[Lanternyard Inc.\|Lanternyard Nullcrafts]] |

Train-like space freighter designed for ultra high capacity transport.

The Freight Car is a multiple kilometer tall, elongated spacecraft which houses all controls for reactor, drive systems and carriage couplings. These ships usually only travel on predetermined trading routes from major spaceports in proximity to jetgates, because their astronomical weights are only economically transportable in short non-gate-travel distances.

## Operational History 

Since its introduction in **2245**, the Freightliner class has revolutionized interstellar cargo transport. Designed to maximize efficiency and capacity, these vessels have become the backbone of Lanternyard Inc.'s vast logistics network. Freightliners have played a pivotal role in establishing new trade routes and supporting colonization efforts across the galaxy. Their ability to consolidate massive cargo loads has led to a monopoly on [[Jetgates|gate travel]], solidifying Lanternyard's dominance in the industry.

## Story Hooks 

- **Missing Freightliner**: A Freightliner carrying critical supplies has vanished near a notorious pirate sector. The players are hired to locate and rescue the vessel before the cargo is lost or falls into the wrong hands.
- **Corporate Espionage**: Rival corporations aim to sabotage a Freightliner to disrupt Lanternyard's supply chain. The players must uncover the plot and protect the ship during its journey.
- **Onboard Crisis**: A malfunction in the Freightliner's fusion reactor threatens to cause a catastrophic failure. The crew enlists the players' help to avert disaster while stranded in deep space.
- **Secret Cargo**: Rumors spread that a Freightliner is transporting an artifact of immense power. The players must decide whether to investigate, protect, or seize the cargo amidst growing tension.
