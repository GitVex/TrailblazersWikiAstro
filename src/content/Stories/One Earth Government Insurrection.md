# Incident: One Earth Government Insurrection

## Overview 

**Date**: Tuesday, 13th of May, 2480

The **[[One Earth Government]] (OEG)** launches a decisive and meticulously planned assault on the [[Helion Sector]] Jetgate, capturing it in a swift operation. This marks the beginning of the sector’s occupation under OEG control.
## Description 
Leveraging decades of covert activity, the OEG secretly amassed a fleet of state-of-the-art combat vessels. These ships were hidden under the guise of pirate operations and criminal syndicates, manipulated and unified by OEG insurgents. The attack was timed to exploit the Unified Planets’ preoccupation with mounting tensions in the Kryx Nebula, which was believed to minimize the risk of retaliation.

In addition to capturing the Jetgate, the OEG systematically neutralized Unified Planets Navy Bases in the sector, crippling local resistance. Despite sporadic skirmishes involving UPN forces and Lanternyard Corporate Security, the Helion Sector falls firmly under OEG control within days. Their intent is to restore the nationalist legacy of the ancient Terran Empire and its goal of capturing earth.
## Location 

[[Helion System]]
## Causes and Effects 

#### Causes
1. **Subversion and Coordination**: Decades of covert operations infiltrated pirate rings and criminal organizations, uniting them under the OEG’s hidden agenda. This allowed them to build a formidable military force unnoticed by galactic authorities.
2. **Strategic Vulnerability**: The Helion Sector’s sparse defense infrastructure and reliance on scattered UP Navy installations created the perfect environment for a decisive strike. The mounting cold war in the nebula fields yielded the perfect opportunity to seize control without risking a focused retaliation.
#### Effect
1. **Declaration of Sovereignty**: The OEG proclaims the Helion Sector as the core of a new sovereign state. This government is unrecognized by the Unified Planets or any other galactic powers.
2. **Economic Isolation**: The OEG refuses to engage in intergalactic trade, instead exploiting the local population and resources to sustain its ambitions.
3. **Humanitarian Crisis**: The sector's inhabitants face oppressive rule, conscription into OEG forces, and resource shortages as the group consolidates its control.
4. **Instability and Rebellion**: Resistance movements begin to organize, though they remain scattered and under-equipped compared to the OEG’s centralized power.

## Additional Details 
**Fleet Composition**: The OEG fleet is comprised of modern, highly modular combat vessels. Confederate intelligence investigations believe these are likely sourced from diverted surplus of the [[Betelgeuse Imperial Shipyards]], though no measures are to be taken due to their involvement in the Terran arms industry. Many reports also speak of stolen or reverse-engineered technologies from unknown sources such as the Shat'azul or even the Precursors.
