# Incident: Terran Civil War 

## Overview

**Date**: Monday, 5th September - 2420 12:00:00 AM

The Terran Civil War marked the final fragmentation of the [[Terran Empire]], culminating in the secession of the [[Confederacy of Terran Gates]]. This pivotal conflict reshaped the galactic landscape, giving rise to new powers, including the Confederacy as a major player vying for dominance.

## Description
The Terran Civil War was the inevitable result of decades of mounting tension within the Terran Empire. Regional Jetgate systems, frustrated by oppressive central governance and deteriorating economic conditions, rose in defiance of the Empire’s authoritarian policies. The Confederacy of Terran Gates formed as a coalition of these rebellious systems, uniting under a shared vision of decentralized governance and control over the vital interstellar Jetgates.

Hostilities began with the Second Gate War in 2416, a conflict that saw the Confederacy’s military forces solidify their independence. By 2420, the war expanded into a full-scale civil war, pitting the Imperial Loyalists—those who sought to preserve the Terran Empire—against the Confederacy and other separatist factions. The war saw significant battles near strategic systems such as Alpha Serpentis and Cygnus, and its conclusion solidified the Confederacy's position as a major galactic power.

## Location
The war’s flashpoints were concentrated around key Jetgates and trade corridors, with notable locations including:

- **Cygnus System**: The symbolic heart of the rebellion, where the Confederacy’s leadership established its headquarters.
- **Alpha Serpentis**: Site of the Serpentis Council, a major political hub for the Confederacy.
- **[[Kryx Nebula Fields]]**: A contested region where battles over resource-rich territories erupted.
- **Betelgeuse and Kepler Gates**: Prominent systems that played key roles in the war, known for their unique cultural traditions and strategic value.

## Causes and Effects

#### Causes

- **Authoritarian Policies**: Centralized control by the Empire alienated regional systems.
- **Economic Exploitation**: The Empire prioritized resource extraction over the welfare of outer colonies.
- **Gate Control Conflicts**: Disputes over the monopolization of Jetgate travel and trade routes.

#### Effects

- **Confederacy Formation**: The Confederacy of Terran Gates emerged as a sovereign entity, rivaling the Unified Planets of Sol.
- **Cultural Revival**: A resurgence of Terran identity took root in Confederate territories, contrasting with Imperial traditions.
- **Galactic Realignment**: The Unified Planets of Sol adopted new defense policies, anticipating further conflicts with the Confederacy.
- **Cold War Dynamics**: The Serengeti Line was established, marking the tense border between the Confederacy and its rivals.

## Relationships

- **Unified Planets of Sol (UPoS)**: Political adversary and primary obstacle to Confederate expansion.
- **Lanternyard Inc.**: Profiteer of the conflict, maintaining lucrative trade with both factions.
- **Sha’tazul and Nomad Clans**: Opportunistic factions capitalized on weakened Imperial defenses to assert influence in border systems.

## Additional Details

- **Confederacy Leadership**: High Commissionate Moreno Rigali emerged as a unifying figure, steering the Confederacy toward a militarized yet decentralized governance model.
- **Serpentis Council**: Became the governing body of the Confederacy, composed of sector representatives known as Gatemasters.
- **Military and Espionage**: The war catalyzed technological innovation in starship design and covert intelligence operations.
