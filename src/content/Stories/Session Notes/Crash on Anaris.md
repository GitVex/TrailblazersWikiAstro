Three bounty hunters crash in the [[Anaris#Northern Dunelands|Northern Dunelands of Anaris]]

## Description 

Before: [[Approach To Anaris]]

The [[LYS Senegali Pride]] drops out of warp next to the Will of God. They hastilly try to fix the Fuel cells and manage to reroute power around the malfunctioning cell and regain control. They limp towards orbit, but a miscalculation (a failed pilot check) lands them too close to the planet.

[[Knives]], [[Chucker]] and [[Skiye]] crash the Freighter in the Northen Dunelands, escaping in a lifeboat and ejecting the other.

They turn on the emergency buoy and hang out in the lifeboat for a few hours, they first reach the [[AMS Midgard]], which declines an call for rescue due to the quarantine status of Anaris. Another 12 hours later, a Freighter answers their distress signal, the [[IS Lantoniaian]]. The Captain agrees to come to their rescue after Knives offers them 200k cillings in **4 days**. They also check Knives' pager signal which leads to the original quest giver. The signal goes 200km East through the Dunelands towards the [[Anaris#The Crater Oasis|Crater Oasis]].
