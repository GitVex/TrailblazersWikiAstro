# Incident 

## Overview 

**Date**: Monday, 18th of May 2453 12:00:00 AM

A group of 3 Bounty Hunters chase a fugitive and subsequently run from the Authorities.

## Description 

A person with a bounty on their head was hiding among the [[Celestian Whiteleaf Faiths|Celestian Whiteleaf Faith]] on the [[Gargantua]] Orbital Port. Coincidentally three Bounty Hunters are sent on their Trail: [[Dogma]], [[Knives]] and [[Max's Albion Character]]. After meeting and realising their common goal, they band together.

They gracefully face the imposter right on the sacred grounds of the Faith. Knives uses their Bag of Beans to conjure a batch of Shriekers (Screaming mushroom). In the end, they kill their target as a group.

This obviously raises the attention of the authorities, which promptly capture the group. After a short interrogation and bribing the police chief [[Colt Fuller]] with a portion of their cut, they are let go to fulfil their mission. But after realizing that some of their equipment was not handed back to them (For some reason I thought this was a good idea) they try to sneak into the police station to get it back, which sets them on the run from the police AGAIN.

Now fleeing through the underbelly of the Station, Knives and Dogma end up on the docked Freightliner [[SPL Arca Planetae|SPL "Arca Planetae"]] by crawling through the idling fuel line. With the help of the Maintenance Bot [[7718 (BILL)]], they manage to get onto the bridge of the Freightliner and undock the tug to use it as their escape vehicle. Due to lacking fuel, the Arca Planetae soon becomes stranded. The trio commandeer one of the parked Lancelot Freighters on the Freightliner, the [[LYS Senegali Pride]]. Using this ship, they escape towards the [[Anaris System]].

After: [[Approach To Anaris]]

## Location 
Gargantua Orbital Port, later the LYS Arca Planetae

## Causes and Effects 
#### Causes
Money

#### Effects
Batch of Shriekers are tamed by the Faith and becomes a staple of their Garden. They also manage to calm it down, so it only screams if it hasn't been tended to in a couple hours.

The LYS Arca Planetae becomes marooned in orbit around Gargantua. A cleanup mission takes several months to stop the ship from falling into the Black Hole. Ultimately, it is being moved to a less gravitational stressful space, then refueled and sent back to its Shipyard for a checkup.
