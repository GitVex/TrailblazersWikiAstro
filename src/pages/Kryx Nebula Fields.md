| [[Simiac Black Hole]]            | Region locked behind gravity anomalies, the approach to the Black Hole is dangerous and full of unpredictable, dense Nebulas.                                                                                                   |

| [[Cephei Glassworks]]            | Company owned cluster of Planets experimenting with various applications of Artificial Metadimensional Mirror Shattering, yielding advancements in fields like stellar navigation, FTL travel, etc.                             |
| The Majorum Drift                | An uncharted zone rumored to harbor pre-warp alien structures. The shifting nebular conditions make charting its perimeter nearly impossible. Occasional expedition teams return with strange artifacts, or not at all.         |
| [[Valkath Anchorage]]            | A sprawling fortress-like asteroid converted into a neutral freeport. Independent traders, explorers, and mercenaries gather here to restock, swap information, and strike deals outside the scrutiny of major galactic powers. |

#### House of Representatives
The House hosts representatives from all independent worlds and alliances of the Kryx Nebula that unite under the Committee's governing body, which is not compulsive, as factions like the Alsafi Caliphate and Oroban Mercantiles abstain from independance and align with other galactic factions. Parties within in the House are:
- **Socialist Kryxian Worlds** - Push for more local independence and less reliance on other galactic factions
- **Trader Unions United** - Focus on commercial deregulation and wealth-building opportunities for entrepreneurial worlds.
- **Democratic Kryxian Frontiers** - Advocates for exploration and territorial reclamation of inaccessible nebula's
- **Violet's for Kryx** - Worries about overmining and ecological damage, pushing for sustainable extraction methods.

| Aṕsygaga Relay           | A rumored “shortcut” corridor not listed on any official CATS chart. Many who attempt to navigate it vanish without a trace.                                                                                      |

## Adventure Hooks 

- **Race Against the Storm**: A once-in-a-decade cosmic storm is projected to sweep across Kryx. Scientists believe it may temporarily stabilize otherwise perilous zones, allowing brief (but lucrative) exploration.
- **Artifact Smuggling**: Strange pre-warp relics rumored to enhance FTL jumps are appearing on black markets. Who discovered these artifacts, and why are they being sold so cheaply?
- **Political Backchannels**: Rival ambassadors vie for alliances with the Oroban Petrochemical Mercantiles. PC involvement could tip the balance, shaping whether Kryx leans towards the UP, Confederacy, or remains staunchly independent.
- **The Gray Exchange Job**: The Exchange needs skilled operatives for an off-the-books retrieval in Simiac Black Hole territory. The pay is astronomical, but so is the risk.
- **Nebula Preservation Crisis**: Ecological activists claim the Cephei Glassworks’ latest experiments threaten the stability of surrounding systems. Investigating the validity of these claims could reveal darker corporate secrets.
