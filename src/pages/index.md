title: Welcome to the Milky Way. It's 2453.
---

> *"A long time into the future. These are the voyages of a group of ragtag adventurers. And there is only war ... sometimes"*

This is the story of the Milky Way, it's a big place. We write the year **2453**. And the galaxy is gearing up for war. The nations of the [[Unified Planets of Sol]] and the [[Confederacy of Terran Gates]] are having a severe divorce fight over the resources of the [[Kryx Nebula Fields]]. One might even call it a Cold War! Because space is cold and heartless. And who else is heartless? The accountants of [[Lanternyard Inc.]]. Every fiscal year the Megacorporation churns out more profit for the galactic rich, and feed the machine with the blood and flesh of their workers. All the while the [[Cirani Nomads]] try to find their home among the stars, and the [[Shat'azul]] are doing what they do best. Keep to themselves and look enigmatic from the corner of the galaxy.

Yet, Lanternyard's Shipyards are the only ones with the means to build ships to use the unknowable [[Jetgates]], left by a precursor who obviously covered their tracks very well when they left to get milk. Every day, from sector to sector, hundreds of ships across the galaxy zip through space at breakneck, faster-than-light speeds propelled by the excrements of a black hole.

And who are you? ... Well ... No one, yet.

So you want to be a space adventurer? You are part of the lower class ... or upper class! Don't let me tell you who you want to be. You could be a spaceship engineer, asteroid miner, star captain, a medic, a corporate medic, a corporate mercenary (if you're a scumbag), a regular mercenary, a criminal spy, a government spy, a diplomat, a scientist, a diplomat scientist, a tribal healer, Judge Dread, Ewan McGregor, Zendaya, a space pirate, a (space-)hacker, an explorer or legitimate salvager. There is really no one you cannot be. Just make sure to tell me.
But who ever you are, you're a weakly wet sack of bones and blood that's walking in a tin can pressurized and only separated by the sickle of Death through a more-or-less thick wall of metal. You're also at the very start of your rise to space hero-ism, regardless of what you did before, so don't expect to have massive resources or connections right off the get go.

But don't let that discourage you, friends are made easy and enemies made even easier, so soon even YOU can find your own fortune on the solar rail. Good luck with the space worms.

See you, Space Cowboy.
